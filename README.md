# Flow - Just go with the flow!
Flow is a water source location mobile app that helps students of the University of Bamenda, Cameroon to find/locate clean water sources.


## Introduction
Flow came about as a result of the persistent water crises in Bambili, Cameroon. This is the location of the University of Bamenda in the North West Region of Cameroon. Due to the high influx of people(students) into this locality, water shortages have been the order of the day. The water is being rationed to ensure everybody gets water (unfortunately not everyone gets water as there are times some areas go weeks without water).

Let's consider two locations in Bambili A and B. As a result of the overpopulation leading to water shortage, there could be water today at A and maybe tomorrow at B. The next day there might be no water at at A and B forcing students to go to say another location, C in search of water. Chances are there might be no water at C and now the students will be forced to go to D. Bottom line nobody knows where exactly water is flowing neither does evrybody know all the possible locations of getting water in Bambili. There are locations which go days or weeks without water; it's very difficult especially for new people in the community to find water. This is where flow comes in to save the day!
